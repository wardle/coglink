# coglink

*coglink* is a simple command-line utility to generate a link to online cognitive assessment questionnaires provided by [Cambridge Cognition](http://www.cambridgecognition.com/)

It essentially makes the existing multi-step web service (requiring separate subject lookup, registration, acquisition of access code and URL generation into a single call). 

The remaining task is to permit it to run as a microservice offering a single URL and a HTTP redirect to the cognitive testing.
